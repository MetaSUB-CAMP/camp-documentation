Upcoming modules
==================
We have so much in the works! Read on to find out more.

## De novo viral phylogenies -- Dec 2022

Vironomy (https://github.com/b-tierney/vironomy) -- an algorithm for classification of viruses and -- additionally -- placing them into giant phylogenetic trees based on conserved HMM discovery.

End-to-end isolate analysis -- Feb 2023
------------------
Tired of sequencing a pure isolate -- or even a mixed community -- and wondering what the hell that thing is? This is an module for assembling/classifying genome/annotating genes/build metabolic models/etc for a given, mystery short read isolate (or simple community). We expect it to feed into a larger comparative genomics pipeline downstream. Will have an extremely limited RAM footprint.

Smaller projects
---------------
* Adding DNA alignments (instead of protein) to gene catalog construction in the gene catalog module
* Adding checkv as an optional flag in the assembly module
