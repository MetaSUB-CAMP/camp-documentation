Welcome to CAMP!
================

The MetaSUB Core Modular Analysis Pipeline, the **CAMP**, is a software toolkit designed for dynamic and educational analyses of metagenomes, bacterial isolates, and, in general, all things microbial. 

The core philosophy of the CAMP is anchored in **modularity**, which is meant to stand in stark contrast to the popular bioinformatic toolkits of "one-click pipelines." By defining every step in an analytic workflow as single, consistently documented and parameterized codebase, we aim to enable users to gain total control over and a deep understand of their bioinformatic analyses. For more information on our design philosophy, check out the :doc:`background` section.
